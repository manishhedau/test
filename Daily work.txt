conda create -n project_folder_name python_version

active env_name

To see the env----> conda env list

To see the how much module we had installed ---> conda list

To installed some package in the new env so just ---> pip install package_name

To remove the env from the system -----> conda env remove -n env_name
it will just remove the env from the your system
